A basic reasoner for the t-box of a subset of OWL2 providing explanations for incoherences.

Warning
-------
TRex is currently only tested for use with the methods described in the given example code. Other methods, though
implemented in the code might not be tested well and might lead to wrong results without any further warning! If you
use methods different from those described in the following you are on your own!

Usage
-----
At the moment TRex is a only library, i.e., it does not bring a command-line interface. However, using TRex is
straight-forward. The entry point for all operations is the TRexReasoner class. It provides a number of different
methods for accessing TRex' functionality. See the class Example.java for an example of using TRex.
